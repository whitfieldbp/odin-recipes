    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is one of my goto recipes when I'm trying to meal prep while tracking my macros. On the first day it's delicious. Subsequent days its probably a little dry so adding a little sauce brings it right back to being amazing. I usually would some Guac salsa or some Srichacha.</p>

        <p>Typically, I'll just add this on top of some brown rice and eat it with brocolli. It gets the job done throughout the week as I'm fueling for performance at the gym.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>-2 lbs Chicken Breast</ul>
        <ul>-1 bottle of Herdez Salsa Verde</ul>
        <ul>-Oregeno</ul>
        <ul>-Salt</ul>
        <ul>-Garlic Powder</ul>
        <ul>-Ground Cumin</ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>1. Place chicken in the crock pot</ol>
        <ol>2. Put oregeno, salt, garlic powder, and cumin over chicken. Just lightly cover with each ingredient</ol>
        <ol>3. Pour whole bottle of salsa verde over chicken covering it</ol>
        <ol>4. Cook on low for about 5-6 hours. High will be about 2.5 hours</ol>
