    <h2>Savory Southern Cole Slaw</h2>
    
    <p>All my life, this is the only cole slaw I'd ever eat. My mom would make it almost every Sunday as one of the pairings for her pot roast. It's a very simple recipe learned from her mother-in-law which makes it unique compared to most restaurants' recipes I'd had. It always seemed to be a hit with friends when I would make it.</p>
